# Automatic Canister Filling 

This is a simple project to control a water outlet by the water level of a canister or a switch. 
I am using this in combination with an osmosis plant to fill canisters with omsosis water.

The 12V solenoid valve is used to enable or disable the water outlet. 
It is controlled by a switch which allows it to be permanently on, permanently off or controlled by the water level switch.
The water level switch is placed inside the canister and can be mounted in such a way, that it opens when the water level rises above.
An RGB LED is used to indicate which switch positions are activated. 
All components are connected to a 12V power supply.
